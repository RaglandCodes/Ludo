# Ludo

This is the 2nd attempt to get it right.

Right now, players can only click on "Roll dice" button and the pieces. The pieces won't move though.

## What's new
- The server ensures no one rolls the dice or clicks on pieces outside their turn
- Placed pieces on the outside
- Implemented dice rolling. Only the player whose turn it is will be allowed to roll the dice.

## Coming next

- When the pieces get clicked, they'll move
