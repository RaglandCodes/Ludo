# Ludo

This is the 2nd attempt to get it right.

Players can roll the dice and make moves equal to the number of the dice

## What's new
- When the pieces get clicked, they'll move

- The server ensures no one rolls the dice or clicks on pieces outside their turn

- Implemented dice rolling. Only the player whose turn it is will be allowed to roll the dice.

## Coming next


## Limitations
- Pieces don't go to the colours boxes yet.

- It doesn't require a 6 to start the game.

- Doesn't handle disconnections well.
